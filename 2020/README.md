# Advent of Code 2020

These solutions are written in TypeScript targeting Deno. I'm mainly aiming for
readability and reusability in my implementations, but whatever ends up here is
just what ended up working first ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

To run:

```console
$ ./run.sh exec $n # for n in {1..25}
```

To test:

```console
$ deno test
```
